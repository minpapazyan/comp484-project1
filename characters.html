          Short, spoiler-light descriptions of key figures. These characters help shape Jin’s choices and
          represent different views on survival, duty, and sacrifice.

            <p class="caption">
              <strong>Jin Sakai</strong><br />
              Born into samurai nobility, Jin is loyal to his uncle and the traditions that shaped him.
              As the invasion grows worse, he begins questioning whether rigid honor truly protects the
              people he loves.

            <p class="caption">
              <strong>Yuna</strong><br />
              A survivor with a practical mindset. Yuna supports Jin while also challenging him to act
              based on results rather than tradition, which influences how he approaches the war.
            </p>

              <strong>Lord Shimura</strong><br />
              Jin’s uncle and a symbol of the samurai code. Shimura represents duty, structure, and
              the belief that honor must be preserved, even in impossible situations.

              <strong>Khotun Khan</strong><br />
              A strategic invader who studies opponents to break them. The Khan relies on intelligence,
              fear, and pressure rather than brute strength alone.

        <h3>Film Influence</h3>
        <p>
          The character-driven tone and pacing often feel connected to older samurai storytelling. A classic
          reference is <cite>Yojimbo</cite>, which helped define many themes seen in later works.
