        <h2>About the Game</h2>

        <p>
          <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is an open-world action-adventure game set on Tsushima Island during
          the Mongol invasion of Japan. You play as Jin Sakai, a samurai who faces a difficult choice:
          follow the traditional code of honor or adapt to new tactics in order to protect his homeland.
        </p>

        <p>
          The game is known for its cinematic presentation, strong atmosphere, and a world design that
          encourages exploration without constantly relying on heavy UI. Its storytelling focuses on duty,
          sacrifice, and how identity can change under pressure.
        </p>

          This site is designed as a simple fan-made overview: spoiler-light story context, a character spotlight,
          and a high-level look at how the game feels to play. The goal is to keep the layout clean and readable
          while showing good HTML structure and consistent styling.

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>

        <p>
          The tone and framing often feel inspired by classic samurai cinema. One example is
          <!-- MDN element: <cite> (not covered in class). Used to cite the title of a creative work. -->
          <cite>Seven Samurai</cite>, which influenced the broader style and themes of many modern samurai stories.
        </p>

        <p>
          The game also captures a “movie-like” feeling through wide scenic shots, dramatic lighting,
          and a strong focus on atmosphere. It’s the kind of experience where the environment itself
          helps tell the story.
