        <h2>Tsushima Island</h2>
        <p>
          Tsushima is portrayed as a rugged and striking island shaped by forests, cliffs, villages,
          coastlines, and open fields. The setting is not just background scenery — it helps build the
          mood and reinforces the themes of isolation, resilience, and responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than feeling like a simple map, Tsushima feels like a living place. The environment helps
          communicate tone: peaceful scenes can become tense quickly, and the world often reflects the
          emotional weight of the story.

        <h2>Historical Backdrop</h2>
        <p>
          The story is set around the first Mongol invasion of Japan in
          <!-- MDN element: <time> (not covered in class). Used to mark a year/date semantically. -->
          <time datetime="1274">1274</time>.
          The game uses this historical anchor to frame a fictional story that focuses on individual choices,
          loyalty, and survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if you don’t know the history, the game makes the threat clear: Tsushima becomes the front line,
          and its people are caught between the invading force and the traditions meant to protect them.
        </p>

      <section class="card" tabindex="0">
        <h2>The Core Conflict</h2>
        <p>
          At the center of the story is a conflict between tradition and survival. Jin Sakai is raised to follow
          a samurai code that values honor, discipline, and confronting enemies directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the invasion escalates, those traditional methods become less effective. Jin is forced to consider
          tactics that are viewed as dishonorable — stealth, deception, and unconventional strategies — all while
          carrying the emotional consequences of those decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>Central Themes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Honor versus pragmatism</li>
          <li>Identity and change</li>
          <li>The cost of protection</li>
        </ul>
