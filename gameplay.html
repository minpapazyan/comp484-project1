        <h2>Exploration</h2>
        <p>
          The world encourages wandering without overwhelming the screen. Instead of constant pop-ups,
          exploration is guided by natural cues like landmarks and environmental direction. This keeps the
          experience immersive and makes the island feel like a real place rather than a checklist.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can spend time discovering quiet locations, scenic paths, and small moments that add personality
          to the world. The pacing can shift from peaceful travel to sudden tension, which keeps the island feeling alive.

        <h2>Combat Feel</h2>
        <p>
          Combat in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> emphasizes timing, positioning, and awareness. Players can
          approach encounters directly or use stealth and tools to control situations.
        </p>

        <h3>Combat Elements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Stance switching for different enemy types</li>
          <li>Parries and dodges that reward careful timing</li>
          <li>Stealth takedowns for tactical advantage</li>
          <li>Tools such as smoke bombs and thrown weapons</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The game’s combat is satisfying because it feels deliberate. The animations and sound design help each
          strike feel weighty, while still allowing smooth movement between actions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card" tabindex="0">
        <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
        <p>
          Wind, music, lighting, and wide landscapes create a calm intensity. Small details — like shrines, villages,
          and wildlife — make the world feel grounded. The overall presentation supports the theme that Tsushima is
          worth protecting, even when the cost is heavy.

          and quickly gained attention for its visual style and cinematic tone. For many players, the experience feels
          less like a typical open-world game and more like a playable film with strong atmosphere.
